I designed and 3D modeled a monitor stand for the 7" Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Monitor as a decoration for my graduation cap. Here is a album of the final results! [ALBUM COMING]

In order to get the monitor on my graduation cap, I 3D printed a custom-made stand out of PLA using a MakerBot Replicator 5. This repository includes the Solidworks assembly of the stand, graduation cap, monitor, Raspberry Pi, and other appropiate parts. STEP AP203 and STEP AP214 files of all the parts are included and .makerbot, .stl, and .thing files of the custom stand are included as well.

Only the dimensions critical for the stand and monitor to assemble can be considered accurate. The official Raspberry Pi mechanical drawing was used as a reference [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/display/7InchDisplayDrawing-14092015.pdf]

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B by Mechatronics Arts[http://bit.ly/2r7Fq6m]. Fastner and standoff models from McMaster-Carr.

All 3D model files starting with "99" I did not make and credit is properly attributed above.
